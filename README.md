# Hacker News Karma Details

This is a Chrome extension that separates out karma on Hacker News into that acquired from comments and that acquired from article submissions.

## Usage

On Hacker News, click on a user profile.  At the moment, information is shown in the console (but this will get fixed really soon :)).


## Issues

* Beyond requiring looking at the console, the extension doesn't properly handle users who have made over 1000 comments/article submissions yet (although I think this is fixable.)


## Credits

This code is distributed under the MIT license (although credit is appreciated).  It makes use of the following code:

* Chrome extension started via Chrome-boilerplate (https://github.com/mahemoff/chrome-boilerplate.)

* Icons came from the HackerNew extension (https://github.com/tommoor/HackerNew).

* Uses Algolia's HN Search API (http://hn.algolia.com/api)

* Thanks to the Launch Hackathon (http://www.hackathon.launch.co/) for the energy to build this.
